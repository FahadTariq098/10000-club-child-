Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy

10,000 Club has a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and child sexual exploitation (CSAE).

We are committed to protecting children and ensuring that our platform is safe, respectful, and free from harmful or illegal content.

1. Prohibited Content

We use in-app reporting and blocking tools to empower users to flag harmful activity.

Reports are reviewed with the highest priority, and urgent cases are escalated immediately.

Where legally required, we cooperate fully with regional and national authorities.
